  <h2>Shared Hosting</h2>

  <p>Shared hosting is the most common type of hosting. It means that multiple websites owned by various
  people are all jammed onto the same server. These are often the slowest to update PHP versions because
  of the potential for breaking many sites. Still, manual upgrade options should be offered to move 
  from one PHP version to another, and automatic updates at the patch level (0.0.X) should be provided.</p>
